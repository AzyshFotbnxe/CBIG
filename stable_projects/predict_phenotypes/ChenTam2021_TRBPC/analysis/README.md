# ANALYSIS
** This folder is mainly for CBIG internal use.**

The functions here contain the analyses that we performed regression, PFM computation, and permutation. Some of the figures and stats in our paper were generated by functions here. Since many of these functions depend on certain files that are not released to public, it will be hard for external users to run the code directly. However, we still release the code in the hope that you do not need to start from scratch when performing similar analyses.

# WHAT DOES EACH FOLDER DO?
## PFM_significance
* This folder computes the significance mask for the PFM of our muilti-kernel FC regression model
* check `CBIG_TRBPC_compute_PFM_significance_mask_wrapper.m` for usage
