## Code Release

This folder contains all matlab data, functions and scripts to show some results we mentioned in the paper. In this experiment, we use dynamic mean-field model to simulate the functional connectivity (FC) obtained from resting-state fMRI in Lausanne parcellation. The details of the model can be referred from our paper.

Please read `README.md` in each sub-folder for details on each step.

#### Step 1: Estimation
The sub-folder `step1x_estimation_lausanne/` contains the first step which will fit the model to the empirical data and estimate parameters.

#### Step 2: Simulation
The sub-folder `step2x_simulation_lausanne/` contains the second step which will simulate the FC using the estimated parameters from Step1: Estimation.
